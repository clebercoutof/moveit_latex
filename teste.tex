	JabRef is an open source reference management software for BibTex \cite{BESIIICollaboration2014}. It has graphic interface, which makes it easy to use \cite{Apalkov2013,Libby2014}. This is why we choose it as our preferred reference management software for BibTex\cite{Silveira2014}. We will explain the features in details in this section \cite{moveit}.
